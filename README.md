### Automatic accessibility evaluation and analytics of NHS General Practices' websites
 
The World Wide Web has improved the lives of many. People with disabilities belong to the users that can benefit most from it. However, to a large extent, the Web is not accessible. The W3C consortium has proposed a set of guidelines that web pages should satisfy to make the websites accessible, i.e. the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

 
While access to health should be universal, if websites containing critical information about the services offered by the National Health Service are not accessible, many citizens get excluded from it.

 
The purpose of this project is to establish a software system to automatically evaluate the websites of General Practices (primary care):
- Analysis of existing automatic evaluation tools to choose those that can be embedded in a software system.
- Use crawlers to collect the URLs and information on the General Practices
- Develop a system that evaluates the accessibility of those websites and stores the results in a regular fashion
- A dashboard that monitors the accessibility of websites over time
- Statistical analysis between compliance to accessibility guidelines
